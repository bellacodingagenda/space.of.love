        <h1>A tale of Thousand Stars</h1></a>
        <p>After a volunteer teacher dies in a tragic accident, her heart is transplanted into Tian.
            He learns about his donor’s life through a series of diary entries that reveal her secrets and interests. 
            Included is her promise to count a thousand stars with Chief Forest Officer Phupha. 
            Tian decides to follow in her footsteps and fulfill her promise.  Now a new volunteer teacher himself,  
            Tian attempts to befriend Phupha, who initially gives him the cold shoulder. 
            As the two slowly grow closer, Tian notices his new heart beats quickly whenever he's near the officer.
             Much like the heart’s previous owner, Tian cannot help but fall for Phupha. Treading on  dangerous ground, 
            can he still go through with the thousand-star promise?</p> <br>
